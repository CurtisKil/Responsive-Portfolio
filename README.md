# Responsive-Portfolio

# Description
  This week we learned about the framework Bootstrap and how to make a responsive website. So with this project that's exactly what I'll be doing. We made a portfolio webiste using HTML and CSS so now were are builing off of that by creating the same thing, but with Bootstrap. With this I'll learn and devleop a new web development skill. 
# Usage
  After this project is finished I will have a responsive portfolio that future employers can access to learn more about me. My projects, skills, and even soe hobbies.
# Credits
  Me and tbh a TA and probably a tutor.
